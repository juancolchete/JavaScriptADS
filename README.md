 This repo, aims to solve the freecodecamp course of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

## Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comment-your-javascript-code)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/blob/main/comment-your-javascript-code.js)  

## Declare JavaScript Variables
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are ```undefined```, ```null```, ```boolean```, ```string```, ```symbol```, ```bigint```, ```number```, and ```object```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/declare-javascript-variables)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/declare-javascript-variables.js)  

## Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (<mark>=</mark>).  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator.js)  

## Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/assigning-the-value-of-one-variable-to-another)

## Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/initializing-variables-with-the-assignment-operator)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/initializing-variables-with-the-assignment-operator.js)  

## Understanding Uninitialized Variables
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of ```undefined```. If you do a mathematical operation on an ```undefined``` variable your result will be ```NaN``` which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an ```undefined``` variable, you will get a literal string of ```undefined```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/understanding-uninitialized-variables)

[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/declare-string-variables)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/declare-string-variables.js)  

## Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (```\```) in front of the quote.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/escaping-literal-quotes-in-strings)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/escaping-literal-quotes-in-strings.js)  

## Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/quoting-strings-with-single-quotes)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/quoting-strings-with-single-quotes.js)  

## Escape Sequences in Strings
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/escape-sequences-in-strings)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/escape-sequences-in-strings.js)  

## Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the ```+``` operator is used with a ```String``` value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-plus-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/concatenating-strings-with-plus-operatorf.js)  

## Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
We can also use the ```+=``` operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-the-plus-equals-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/concatenating-strings-with-the-plus-equals-operator.js)  

## Constructing Strings with Variables
Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (```+```), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/constructing-strings-with-variables)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/constructing-strings-with-variables.js)  

## Appending Variables to Strings
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (```+=```) operator.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/appending-variables-to-strings)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/appending-variables-to-strings.js)  

## Find the Length of a String
You can find the length of a ```String``` value by writing ```.length``` after the string variable or string literal.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/find-the-length-of-a-string)    
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/find-the-length-of-a-string.js)  


## Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-first-character-in-a-string)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-first-character-in-a-string.js)  

## Understand String Immutability
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/understand-string-immutability)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/understand-string-immutability.js)  

## Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-character-in-a-string)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-character-in-a-string.js)  

## Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-last-character-in-a-string)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-last-character-in-a-string.js)  

## Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-to-last-character-in-a-string)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-to-last-character-in-a-string.js)  

## Word Blanks
We will now use our knowledge of strings to build a "[Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)" style word game we're calling "Word Blanks". You will create an (optionally humorous) "Fill in the Blanks" style sentence.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/word-blanks)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/word-blanks.js)  

## Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

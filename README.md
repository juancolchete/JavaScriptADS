# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
 This repo, aims to solve the freecodecamp course of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

## Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

## Declare JavaScript Variables
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are ```undefined```, ```null```, ```boolean```, ```string```, ```symbol```, ```bigint```, ```number```, and ```object```.

## Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (<mark>=</mark>).

## Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

## Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

## Understanding Uninitialized Variables
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of ```undefined```. If you do a mathematical operation on an ```undefined``` variable your result will be ```NaN``` which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an ```undefined``` variable, you will get a literal string of ```undefined```.

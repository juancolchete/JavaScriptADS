# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
 This repo, aims to solve the freecodecamp course of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

## Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

## Declare JavaScript Variables
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are <mark>undefined</mark>, <mark>null</mark>, <mark>boolean</mark>, <mark>string</mark>, <mark>symbol</mark>, <mark>bigint</mark>, <mark>number</mark>, and <mark>object</mark>.

## Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (<mark>=</mark>).

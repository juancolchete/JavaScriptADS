# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
 This repo, aims to solve the freecodecamp course of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

## Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

## Declare JavaScript Variables
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are ```undefined```, ```null```, ```boolean```, ```string```, ```symbol```, ```bigint```, ```number```, and ```object```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/declare-javascript-variables)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/declare-javascript-variables.js)  

## Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (<mark>=</mark>).  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator.js)  

## Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/assigning-the-value-of-one-variable-to-another)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/assigning-the-value-of-one-variable-to-another.js)  

## Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/initializing-variables-with-the-assignment-operator)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/initializing-variables-with-the-assignment-operator.js)  

## Understanding Uninitialized Variables
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of ```undefined```. If you do a mathematical operation on an ```undefined``` variable your result will be ```NaN``` which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an ```undefined``` variable, you will get a literal string of ```undefined```.

## Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
We can also multiply one number by another.

[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/multiply-two-numbers-with-javascript.js)  

## Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/understanding-case-sensitivity-in-variables)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/understanding-case-sensitivity-in-variables.js)  

## Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
```Number``` is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/add-two-numbers-with-javascript)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/add-two-numbers-with-javascript.js)  

## Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
We can also subtract one number from another.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/subtract-one-number-from-another-with-javascript)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/subtract-one-number-from-another-with-javascript.js)  

## Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
We can also divide one number by another.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/divide-one-number-by-another-with-javascript)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/divide-one-number-by-another-with-javascript.js)  

## Increment a Number with JavaScript
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ```++``` operator.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/increment-a-number-with-javascript)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/increment-a-number-with-javascript.js)  

## Decrement a Number with JavaScript
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the ```--``` operator.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/decrement-a-number-with-javascript)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/decrement-a-number-with-javascript.js)  

## Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/create-decimal-numbers-with-javascript)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/create-decimal-numbers-with-javascript.js)

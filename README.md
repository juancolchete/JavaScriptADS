# Basic Javascript

## Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comment-your-javascript-code)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/blob/main/basic-javascript/comment-your-javascript-code.js)  
## Declare JavaScript Variables
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are ```undefined```, ```null```, ```boolean```, ```string```, ```symbol```, ```bigint```, ```number```, and ```object```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/declare-javascript-variables)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/declare-javascript-variables.js)  

## Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (```=```).  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator.js)  

## Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/assigning-the-value-of-one-variable-to-another)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/assigning-the-value-of-one-variable-to-another.js)  

## Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/initializing-variables-with-the-assignment-operator)   
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/initializing-variables-with-the-assignment-operator.js)  

## Understanding Uninitialized Variables
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of ```undefined```. If you do a mathematical operation on an ```undefined``` variable your result will be ```NaN``` which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an ```undefined``` variable, you will get a literal string of ```undefined```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/understanding-uninitialized-variables)

In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-addition)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-addition.js)  

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the ```+=``` operator, ```-=``` subtracts a number from a variable.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-subtraction)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-subtraction.js)  

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The ```*=``` operator multiplies a variable by a number.

[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-division)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-division.js)  

## Declare String Variables
Create two new string variables: ```myFirstName``` and ```myLastName``` and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/declare-string-variables)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/declare-string-variables.js)  

## Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (```\```) in front of the quote.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/escaping-literal-quotes-in-strings)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/escaping-literal-quotes-in-strings.js)  

## Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/quoting-strings-with-single-quotes)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/quoting-strings-with-single-quotes.js)  

## Escape Sequences in Strings
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/escape-sequences-in-strings)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/escape-sequences-in-strings.js)  

## Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the ```+``` operator is used with a ```String``` value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-plus-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-plus-operatorf.js)  

## Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
We can also use the ```+=``` operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-the-plus-equals-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-the-plus-equals-operator.js)  

## Constructing Strings with Variables
Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (```+```), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/constructing-strings-with-variables)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/constructing-strings-with-variables.js)  

## Appending Variables to Strings
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (```+=```) operator.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/appending-variables-to-strings)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/appending-variables-to-strings.js)  

## Find the Length of a String
You can find the length of a ```String``` value by writing ```.length``` after the string variable or string literal.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/find-the-length-of-a-string)    
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/find-the-length-of-a-string.js)  


## Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-first-character-in-a-string)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-first-character-in-a-string.js)  

## Understand String Immutability
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/understand-string-immutability)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/understand-string-immutability.js)  

## Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-character-in-a-string)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-character-in-a-string.js)  

## Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-last-character-in-a-string)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-last-character-in-a-string.js)  

## Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-to-last-character-in-a-string)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-to-last-character-in-a-string.js)  

## Word Blanks
We will now use our knowledge of strings to build a "[Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)" style word game we're calling "Word Blanks". You will create an (optionally humorous) "Fill in the Blanks" style sentence.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/word-blanks)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/word-blanks.js)  

## Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/store-multiple-values-in-one-variable-using-javascript-arrays)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/store-multiple-values-in-one-variable-using-javascript-arrays.js)  

## Nest one Array within Another Array
You can also nest arrays within other arrays.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/nest-one-array-within-another-array)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/nest-one-array-within-another-array.js)  

## Access Array Data with Indexes
We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/access-array-data-with-indexes)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/access-array-data-with-indexes.js)  

## Modify Array Data With Indexes
Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/modify-array-data-with-indexes)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/modify-array-data-with-indexes.js)

## Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/access-multi-dimensional-arrays-with-indexes)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/access-multi-dimensional-arrays-with-indexes.js)  

## Manipulate Arrays With push()
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the ```push()``` function.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/manipulate-arrays-with-push)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/modify-array-data-with-indexes.js)  

## Manipulate Arrays With pop()
Another way to change the data in an array is with the ```.pop()``` function.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/manipulate-arrays-with-pop)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/manipulate-arrays-with-pop.js)  

## Manipulate Arrays With shift()
```pop()``` always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?  
That's where ```.shift()``` comes in. It works just like ```.pop()```, except it removes the first element instead of the last.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/manipulate-arrays-with-shift)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/manipulate-arrays-with-shift.js)  

## Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
Not only can you ```shift``` elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also ```unshift``` elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/manipulate-arrays-with-unshift)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/manipulate-arrays-with-unshift.js) 

## Shopping List
Create a shopping list in the variable ```myList```. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/shopping-list)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/shopping-list.js)

## Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/write-reusable-javascript-with-functions)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/write-reusable-javascript-with-functions.js)  

## Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/passing-values-to-functions-with-arguments)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/passing-values-to-functions-with-arguments.js)  

## Global Scope and Functions
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/global-scope-and-functions)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/global-scope-and-functions.js)  

## Local Scope and Functions
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/local-scope-and-functions)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/local-scope-and-functions.js)  

## Global vs. Local Scope in Functions
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/global-vs--local-scope-in-functions)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/global-vs--local-scope-in-functions.js)  

## Return a Value from a Function with Return
We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a ```return``` statement to send a value back out of a function.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/return-a-value-from-a-function-with-return)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/return-a-value-from-a-function-with-return.js)  


## Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
A function can include the ```return``` statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a ```return``` statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is ```undefined```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/understanding-undefined-value-returned-from-a-function)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/understanding-undefined-value-returned-from-a-function.js)  

## Assignment with a Returned Value
If you'll recall from our discussion of [Storing Values with the Assignment Operator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator), everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/assignment-with-a-returned-value)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/assignment-with-a-returned-value.js)  

## Stand in Line
In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/stand-in-line)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/stand-in-line.js)  

## Understanding Boolean Values
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: ```true``` or ```false```. They are basically little on-off switches, where ```true``` is on and ```false``` is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/understanding-boolean-values)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/understanding-boolean-values.js)  

## Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
```If``` statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword ```if``` tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as ```Boolean``` conditions and they may only be ```true``` or ```false```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-conditional-logic-with-if-statements)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/use-conditional-logic-with-if-statements.js) 

## Comparison with the Equality Operator
There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean ```true``` or ```false``` value.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-equality-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-equality-operator.js)  

## Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-strict-equality-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-strict-equality-operator.js)  

## Practice comparing different values
In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (```==```) and the strict equality operator (```===```). Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/practice-comparing-different-values)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/practice-comparing-different-values.js)

## Comparison with the Inequality Operator
he inequality operator (```!=```) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means not equal and returns ```false``` where equality would return ```true``` and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-inequality-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-inequality-operator.js)  

## Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator
The strict inequality operator (```!==```) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns ```false``` where strict equality would return ```true``` and vice versa. The strict inequality operator will not convert data types.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-strict-inequality-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-strict-inequality-operator.js)  

## Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
The greater than operator (```>```) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns ```true```. Otherwise, it returns ```false```.

[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-greater-than-operator.js)  

## Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
The greater than or equal to operator (```>=```) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns ```true```. Otherwise, it returns ```false```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-greater-than-or-equal-to-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-greater-than-or-equal-to-operator.js)  

## Comparison with the Less Than Operator
The less than operator (```<```) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns ```true```. Otherwise, it returns ```false```. Like the equality operator, the less than operator converts data types while comparing.

[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-less-than-or-equal-to-operator.js)  

## Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (```&&```) returns ```true``` if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparisons-with-the-logical-and-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/comparisons-with-the-logical-and-operator.js)  

## Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
The logical or operator (```||```) returns ```true``` if either of the operands is ```true```. Otherwise, it returns ```false```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparisons-with-the-logical-or-operator)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/comparisons-with-the-logical-or-operator.js)  

## Introducing Else Statements
When a condition for an ```if``` statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an ```else``` statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/introducing-else-statements)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/introducing-else-statements.js)  

## Introducing Else If Statements
If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/introducing-else-if-statements)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/introducing-else-if-statements.js)  

## Logical Order in If Else Statements
Order is important in ```if```, ```else if``` statements.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/logical-order-in-if-else-statements)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/logical-order-in-if-else-statements.js) 

## Chaining If Else Statements
```if/else``` statements can be chained together for complex logic.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/chaining-if-else-statements)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/chaining-if-else-statements.js)  

## Golf Code
In the game of golf, each hole has a ```par```, meaning, the average number of ```strokes``` a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below ```par``` your ```strokes``` are, there is a different nickname.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/golf-code)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/golf-code.js)  

## Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A ```switch``` statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched ```case``` value until a ```break``` is encountered.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/selecting-from-many-options-with-switch-statements)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/selecting-from-many-options-with-switch-statements.js)  

## Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
In a ```switch``` statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as ```case``` statements. Instead, you can add the ```default``` statement which will be executed if no matching ```case``` statements are found. Think of it like the final ```else``` statement in an ```if/else``` chain.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/adding-a-default-option-in-switch-statements)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/adding-a-default-option-in-switch-statements.js) 

## Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
If the ```break``` statement is omitted from a ```switch``` statement's ```case```, the following ```case``` statement(s) are executed until a ```break``` is encountered.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/multiple-identical-options-in-switch-statements)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/multiple-identical-options-in-switch-statements.js)  

## Replacing If Else Chains with Switch
If you have many options to choose from, a ```switch``` statement can be easier to write than many chained ```if```/```else if``` statements.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/replacing-if-else-chains-with-switch)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/replacing-if-else-chains-with-switch.js)  

## Returning Boolean Values from Functions
You may recall from [Comparison with the Equality Operator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-equality-operator) that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/returning-boolean-values-from-functions)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/returning-boolean-values-from-functions.js)  

## Return Early Pattern for Functions
When a ```return``` statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/return-early-pattern-for-functions)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/return-early-pattern-for-functions.js)  

## Counting Cards
In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/counting-cards)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/counting-cards.js) 

## Build JavaScript Objects
Objects are similar to ```arrays```, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called ```properties```.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/build-javascript-objects)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/build-javascript-objects.js)  

## Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (```.```) and bracket notation (```[]```), similar to an array.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-object-properties-with-dot-notation)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/accessing-object-properties-with-dot-notation.js)  

## Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation (```[]```). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-object-properties-with-bracket-notation)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/accessing-object-properties-with-bracket-notation.js)  

## Accessing Object Properties with Variables
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-object-properties-with-variables)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/accessing-object-properties-with-variables.js)  

## Updating Object Properties 
After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/updating-object-properties)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/updating-object-properties.js)  

## Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object 
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them. 
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/add-new-properties-to-a-javascript-object)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/add-new-properties-to-a-javascript-object.js)  

## Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object
We can also delete properties from objects like this:
```
delete ourDog.bark;
```
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/delete-properties-from-a-javascript-object)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/delete-properties-from-a-javascript-object.js)  

## Using Objects for Lookups
Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to lookup values rather than a ```switch``` statement or an ```if/else``` chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/using-objects-for-lookups)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/using-objects-for-lookups.js)  

## Testing Objects for Properties
Testing Objects for PropertiesPassed
Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the ```.hasOwnProperty(propname)``` method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. ```.hasOwnProperty()``` returns ```true``` or ```false``` if the property is found or not.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/testing-objects-for-properties)    
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/testing-objects-for-properties.js)  

## Manipulating Complex Objects
Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/manipulating-complex-objects)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/manipulating-complex-objects.js)  

## Accessing Nested Objects
The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-nested-objects)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/accessing-nested-objects.js) 

## Accessing Nested Arrays
As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-nested-arrays)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/accessing-nested-arrays.js)  

## Record Collection
You are given an object literal representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has a unique id number as its key and several other properties. Not all albums have complete information.

[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/record-collection.js)  

## Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-while-loops)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-while-loops.js) 

## Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-for-loops)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-for-loops.js)  

## Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our ```final-expression```, we can count by even numbers.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-odd-numbers-with-a-for-loop)
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/iterate-odd-numbers-with-a-for-loop.js)

## Count Backwards With a For Loop
A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/count-backwards-with-a-for-loop)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/count-backwards-with-a-for-loop.js)  

## Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop
A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a ```for``` loop.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-through-an-array-with-a-for-loop)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/iterate-through-an-array-with-a-for-loop.js)  

## Nesting For Loops
If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/nesting-for-loops)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/nesting-for-loops.js)  


## Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops
The next type of loop you will learn is called a ```do...while loop```. It is called a ```do...while``` loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-do---while-loops)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-do---while-loops.js)  

## Replace Loops using Recursion
Recursion is the concept that a function can be expressed in terms of itself. To help understand this, start by thinking about the following task: multiply the first ```n``` elements of an array to create the product of those elements.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/replace-loops-using-recursion)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/replace-loops-using-recursion.js)

[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/generate-random-whole-numbers-with-javascript.js)  

## Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/generate-random-whole-numbers-within-a-range)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/generate-random-whole-numbers-within-a-range.js)  

## Use the parseInt Function
The ```parseInt()``` function parses a string and returns an integer.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-the-parseint-function)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/use-the-parseint-function.js)  

## Use the parseInt Function with a Radix
The ```parseInt()``` function parses a string and returns an integer. It takes a second argument for the radix, which specifies the base of the number in the string. The radix can be an integer between 2 and 36.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-the-parseint-function-with-a-radix)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/use-the-parseint-function-with-a-radix.js)  


## Use the Conditional (Ternary) Operator
The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.

## Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators
In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-multiple-conditional-ternary-operators)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/basic-javascript/use-multiple-conditional-ternary-operators.js)  

## Use Recursion to Create a Countdown
In a [previous challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-multiple-conditional-ternary-operators), you learned how to use recursion to replace a for loop. Now, let's look at a more complex function that returns an array of consecutive integers starting with 1 through the number passed to the function.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-recursion-to-create-a-countdown)

# ECMAScript 6

## Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords
When you declare a variable with the ```var``` keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.  
The ```let``` keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the ```let``` keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.    
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/compare-scopes-of-the-var-and-let-keywords)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/es6/compare-scopes-of-the-var-and-let-keywords.js)  

## Mutate an Array Declared with const
Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using ```const``` by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use ```let```.  
However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using ```const``` are still mutable. Using the ```const``` declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.  
[statement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/mutate-an-array-declared-with-const)  
[solution](https://github.com/juanudk/JavaScriptADS/blob/main/es6/mutate-an-array-declared-with-const.js)
